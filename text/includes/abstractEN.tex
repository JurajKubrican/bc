This thesis’ main focus is on the advantages of using graph database management system in a real world application.

The first chapter of this thesis focuses on the comparison of graph databases to relational and document oriented databases.  Next the thesis contains the specification and design of an application that uses Neo4J graph database. Next chapter focuses on the implementation of a web application for planning and optimization of travel routes. The following chapter contains tests done on the real world data generated by the application.  The tests compare the speed of graph traversal in relational and graph databases and show the latency advantage the use of graph databases provide. Another benefits of using a graph database is the database model and tooling suitable for use with graph-like datasets.
